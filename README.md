# dy_integrated_5

A work in progress Mobile App meant to provide a better way to access student information, over the old site
that has multiple unnecessary redirects and no relevant Android App. Forcing a poor web experience onto its users.
This app aims to solve that problem by providing the core data with a Modern Interface. 

It also supports directly downloading and saving, preventing the need to go through the very 2013-ish Flexpaper
pdf viewer available on the Old Site.


# Todo
    - Update the ApiService Class to be in line with the rest of the application by using riverpod providers instead of static methods. [Done]     
    - Improve caching and minimize number of request to the proxy authentication (dyp-flask) [Done]
    - Add a more extensive Attendance Tab [In progress]
    - Dark Mode (Rivepod Provider based theming, I suppose) [In progress]
