A work in progress Mobile App meant to provide a better way to access student information, over the old site
that has multiple unnecessary redirects and no relevant Android App. Forcing a poor web experience onto its users.
This app aims to solve that problem by providing the core data with a Modern Interface. 

It also supports directly downloading and saving, preventing the need to go through the very 2013-ish Flexpaper
pdf viewer available on the Old Site.
